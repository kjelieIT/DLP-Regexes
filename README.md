# DLP Regex Collection

A curated set of regular expressions designed for Data Loss Prevention (DLP) use cases. This repository provides patterns to detect sensitive information such as PII, financial data, and authentication credentials in text files, logs, and code repositories.

## Repository Structure

* `DLP_REGEX_COLLECTION.md` – Detailed catalog of regex patterns organized by category, each with explanations, examples, and usage notes.
* `dlp_patterns.yml` – (Optional) Machine-readable YAML file listing all patterns for automated tooling. (WIP)
* `examples/` – Sample test strings and scripts demonstrating how to run and validate the regex patterns.

## Getting Started

1. **Review the Patterns**
   Open `DLP_REGEX_COLLECTION.md` to explore available regexes and their descriptions.

2. **Integrate in Your Tool** (WIP)

   * Import the YAML definitions (`dlp_patterns.yml`) into your DLP solution or custom scanner.
   * Use the regex patterns directly in your scanning configuration.

3. **Test & Customize**

   * Use provided test strings to verify matches and tune patterns for your environment.
   * Add or modify patterns as needed for region‑specific or company‑specific identifiers.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to extend this collection with new patterns, improvements, or region‑specific identifiers.
